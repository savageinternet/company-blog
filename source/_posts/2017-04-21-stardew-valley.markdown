* inclusivity (race, gender, same-sex romances/families)
* talking about mental health (depression, PTSD, alcoholism/effects on family; everybody has "something going on")
* pro-social (rebuild community centre, your friendship measurably improves peoples' lives, filling out the museum / contributing to local knowledge)
* meditative (late to the boat here, but lots of people playing to escape RL)
* mastery learning (fishing game, each fish has a unique signature that you come to learn over time)
