Welcome to the [Savage Internet](https://savageinter.net) company blog!  You can follow our blog via [RSS](http://localhost:4000/atom.xml) to keep on top of Savage Internet thoughts, announcements, and game design notes!

We're currently preparing for our upcoming July release of The Puzzling Madness of John A. Macdonald, a scavenger / puzzle hunt set in Confederation-era Toronto.  We'll have more information as development continues!  In the meantime, those interested in playtesting the game before July can fill out our [playtester signup form](https://goo.gl/forms/1sLRIZEUzEf9ViLJ3).

We're also working with Toronto-area scientists to plan something exciting for [Science Rendezvous Dundas Square](http://www.ryerson.ca/sciencerendezvous/) on May 13, 2017.  Until then, our lips are sealed - you'll have to attend or wait until afterwards for the recap, which we'll post here!
